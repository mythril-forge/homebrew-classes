### Instinctive Spell
- **Cost:** variable

You can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's conversion rate to cast any spell on the sorcerer spell list &mdash; even if you haven't learned the spell.
The spell must either be a cantrip or of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Sorcerer Table.

As normal, you must spend the associated level spell slot when you cast the spell.

This metamagic's cost is 1 sorcery point if the spell that you cast is a cantrip.
